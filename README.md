# Restaurant_bill_calculator

```
The project file contains a python script (login.py, question.py, and others).This is a simple GUI based application which is very easy to understand and use.It uses Tkinter module for the GUI.Talking about the application, the user just has to select among the food and drinks items, enter the quantity and click on the total button to view the total price. This simple application also displays the total prices of each item without any tax and extra charges.

After running the program, the user has to login by providing the username and pin number.If the username or password is incorrect it pops out a authentication error.If it matches then the system asks whether to continue to the application or change the price of foods. The user can view the total receipt of their items which displays receipt number and number of their food/drinks items with the total amount. Here, the total bill of the customer includes tax and service charges too. In order to change the price of foods, the user just has to enter the price and click on the update button, it’ll change that particular item’s price.

The design is so simple that the user won’t find any difficulties while working on it. In order to run the project, you must have installed Python and on your PC.
